<p>In mathematics the Singleton is known as a set with exactly one element.  This is symbolized with the markdown of:  {0}.  As far as the ideas of our product suite goes, it may not contain one element, but it is built as a single element giving you access to a whole range of products, development frameworks and ideas.  All this is made for one simple thing:  To add value to our clients while adding value to the open source community who we see as our colleagues, peers and in some cases even our clients.</p>

<p>While this is very fuzzy at this stage, stay tuned as we make complex things simple.</p>
